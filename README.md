# Simple-automatic-receiver
This project was submitted to Question F, "Simple Automatic Receiver," for the 2025 National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest.  
You can find the competition requirements here: https://res.nuedc-training.com.cn/topic/2024/topic_111.html  
Because the design was continuously revised until the very last morning, it unfortunately only received a provincial third prize.   
However, this plan is indeed feasible. This is for reference only.  
This system consists of an STM32F407(VGt6) controlling two ADCs, a DAC, an RDA5820 (FM Demodulator), and an AD9959 (DDS), as well as several LNAs, multiplier (AD835), power divider, low-pass filter, power supply module, and power amplifier.
